If I could go back in time, back to my younger self in Nigeria with minimal responsibility and maximum freedom, I would have carefully analyzed the activities that I did, and distinguish them between two categories: **consumption** and **creation**. In retrospect, most of my childhood activities would fall under the former category. Watching movies, playing video games, and reading comic books are some examples of consumptive activity–tasks that involve taking in large chunks of content, whether that be information, music, or nutrients.

Although I did a lot of consumptive activities, my childhood years were nonetheless some of the happiest till date. Most of my memories of childhood days excite me. Activities that I will now consider boring and mundane now were enchanting to me. It’s as though I was passionate about every single detail in life, from the gust of wind flowing past my face while biking around my house to the eeriness of the insects I discovered everyday in the garden. Nowadays, everything seems repetitive. It’s as if all the chromatic imagery of experiences as a younger child contrasts with the black-and-white “reality” of entering adulthood. I’ve always thought that this shift was an inevitable process of becoming an adult, something that everyone will have to experience at some points in their lives. However, it dawned on me that there’s a plethora of opportunities to reignite that passion of life, that chromatic feel of experiences. My childhood memories were mostly appealing because I did a lot of creative activities–tasks that involve using imagination and original ideas. These activities, such as drawing, creating a house model with popsicle sticks, and shooting short skits, brought life and fulfillment to me.

My adolescence years came with a lot more opportunities to passively partake in consumptive activities. When I moved to the US at age 13, I was astonished by how easy it was to access any kind of information on earth. Using apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and Netflix were replacing activities like learning how to draw Dexter, creating an imaginary friend with paper called ‘Peggy’, and learning how to make the fastest paper airplanes. As the ratio of my categorized activities shifted while I got older, I noticed two major changes in my behavior:

- I began to lose excitement for a lot of things that I did

- My sense of imaginative thinking was slowly diminishing

I believe that there is a directly proportional relationship between **creative activities** and **overall happiness & fulfillment**. The more time that I spend doing creative things (such as writing this article), the happier that I am because I’m sharing a part of myself with the world. By no means am I saying that consumption is a subtractive lifestyle. However I believe that it is important for everyone to find a healthy equilibrium of activities by which they give as much to the world as they have taken out of it.
