# That time of the year has come again.

My sophomore year classes begin. My indecisiveness has made me oscillate among the three disciplines of Economics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. "_Why not just do all three?_" well because that's, quite frankly, something I'm not capable of doing. Anyway, I have decided to continue my pathway of double-majoring in Economics and Computer Science. Just that this time, I am in the College of Arts and Sciences rather than in the School of Engineering.

I will be taking my approach to classes a little differently now. I will no longer see it as just mere studying and taking exams. My goal is to integrate it as much as a can with my daily life. Hence, I will be using this platform as an opportunity to document my inquiries related (whether strongly or loosely) to the course. Withouth further ado, here's a list of the courses that I'm taking.


__---__
- __CS 2281: Computer Architecture__
- __FREN 1101: Introduction to French in the World__
- __ECON 3012: Microeconomics__
- __HUM 1610: Selected Topics: AI and Society__
- __CS 3265: Database Management Systems__

It's a pretty rigorous schedule. It's the most that I've taken so far at Vanderbilt.

I believe that the first step towards success is honesty. I have a confession to make: I have not been doing too well academically. I ended my first year with a 3.45 GPA, which is far from my aspiring GPA for my future pursuits. For me to reach the benchmark that I desire, there will be a lot of sacrifices that I have to take.

Okay that was a tangent. Back to business.

If any of my inquiries are related to any of/a combination of the classes that I'm taking, I will most likely prefix the title with the shortened name of the course (e.g ECON 3012: Do Consumers Really Have a Choice?). My hopes are that by applying what I'm learning into my personal life by ruminating on the concepts learned and passively forming connections withing the concepts and among other concepts, I will enrich my learning experience.

At the end of the day, this is an experiment. We'll see how it goes. Hoping for success.

And last but not least, _So help me God._
