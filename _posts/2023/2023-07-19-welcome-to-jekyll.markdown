Hello guys.

For those of you that are close with me, you may be aware that I have WordPress [site](https://teguono.com) where I write my monthly blogs.

I have decided to switch from WordPress to `Jekyll`.

This is primarily due to an increased realization of my objectives. Writing has been one of the most fulfilling things I've exercised in 2023. However, I believe that pairing this with programming will highly enhance my thinking and ideating skills. I don't only want to conceptualize my ideas through _pen on paper_ (metaphorically speaking) but also through rigorous technical applications.

I believe that getting the best out of both practices will immensely help me to acheive **PLAN A** in the long run (more on **PLAN A-C** in a future blog).

Full migration should happen by the end of this month. Domain name should stay the same (teguono.com).

And so the next stage of my journey begins.
