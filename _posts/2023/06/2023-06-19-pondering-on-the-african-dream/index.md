My family and I moved to the United States from Nigeria in December 2017 because of the wide range of opportunities that the U.S provides. Living here, I've had access to an excellent education, unlimited electricity (to surf the internet at the ease of one's desire), and several other privileges to maximize my potential to reach and reimagine my personal aspirations. "The land of the free" did indeed live up to my expectations, and I had set a goal to maximize my utility from the abundance of resources provided in this nation.

Five years later, I've tried my best to make the most out of what this nation has given to me. I've met some of the smartest, hard-working people that have driven me to excel academically and professionally. I have built a blockchain company along with some other friends and produced a decent amount of wealth from it. I explored my athletic abilities by playing four different sports throughout my high school career. I am going to a respected institution that provides me with more than enough that I need to climb each rung of my highly ambitious ladder. I'm now a college freshman, and I'd like to believe that I've learned as much (or even more) about the culture, politics, and economics that drives America compared to the average American.

It's like a dream come true. Every Nigerian wants to be in the position that I'm in right now. This glorified nation has attracted the eyes of many with its promise of the "American Dream", a guarantee of equal opportunity to every one that resides in the U.S. I'm aware that this perpetual cycle of Nigerians immigrating to the U.S. and U.K. might not end anytime soon, but it really got me wondering–why isn't there an "African Dream''? Why can't Africa be the hub where people from around the world flock to maximize the resources that it can provide to them? I have faith in the immense value that Africa can provide to the world. However, we've (myself and the rest of Africa) barely scratched the surface to realize these values.

Now, I could get into the history of how Africa got to where it is today. I can point fingers to the several colonizers that exploited our resources for the sake of social influence and economic opportunity. I could blame the kleptocracy by which the majority of Africa's constituents accept as a reality. While I believe that understanding Africa's history can give insight into what might need to be fixed today, it also sadly gives us the reason to put the blame on systems, on foreigners, on politics placing the burden of responsibilities on them. I think the latter is what is keeping Africa stagnant, relative to the rest of the world.

Unfortunately, most African countries do not have a self-sufficient economy. We always rely on foreign aid and gifts from nations like the U.S. and U.K. to meet our basic needs rather than to implement wealth-creating strategies. We have neither the necessary infrastructure nor the clever directives to capitalize on our burgeoning sectors. I've recently been digging deep into the concept of **Africapitalism**–a term coined by Nigerian businessman Tony Elumelu–and Tony and I share very similar ideas about the unrealized values that Africa has yet to discover. More-so, we share near-identical visions on the strategic economic initiatives needed to bootstrap Africa's economy.

In short, Africapitalism is the idea that long-term investment and a bolstered entrepreneurial ecosystem can lead to not only economic prosperity but also social wealth. In other words, careful investments in entrepreneurship and promising sectors can lead to not only prosperous businesses and industries within Africa's economy, but can simultaneously tackle some of the most pressing issues that reside in the continent such as unemployment, poverty, and underdevelopment.

I will be writing a detailed review on Africapitalism in a future blog–I've been scouring through several sources to deepen my understanding about this concept–but I do believe that it might be the foundation needed to build the "African Dream"
