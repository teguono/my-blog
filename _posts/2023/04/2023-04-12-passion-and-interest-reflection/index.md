_What motivates you?_

Finding the truth. For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been trying to figure out what I’ve wanted to do with my life. A lot of this involves trying out new things–trying out new hobbies, joining new student organizations, and trying out new courses. To be very honest, it’s been difficult for me to find clarity in the things that I’m doing out there. There are a plethora of opportunities that I can delve into, but it feels like just a set of data points that are randomly dispersed on a plane of space and time. I wish there was a way for me to connect those dots.

I read a famous quote on Twitter yesterday. It said that life can only be understood backwards but needs to be lived forwards. This strongly resonated with me. Whenever I live at the moment, it seems like there’s no certain direction as to where life takes me, but whenever I look back in time, it seems like everything all made sense. It makes sense though–one can not reverse-engineer something that has not even been fully engineered. Hence, the crucial aspect that needs to be focused on is the momentary engineering itself. It’s about asking questions, sparking curiosity, not obsessing about what the final engineering product should be.

The unique attribute of time is that it only moves in one direction, and it’s one of the very few entities that has infinite momentum–nothing can stop it. However, the beauty with time is that it leaves back traces of the past: historical records, fossils, decay, death. Without understanding this past, I highly doubt that we will understand ourselves (or perhaps even the need to understand ourselves in the first place). In essence, I will generalize this phenomenon that time has left us behind as **data**. Data gives us hints of the universe how it works–how certain things didn’t work out, and what made things work out. It could also have the potential to provide us instructions on what to do in the future. For example, extracting and finding meaning in data from the past historical events can help us not only understand how we got to where we were today, but to also predict what may happen in the future and how to mitigate those effects. The beauty of data is endless, and I think that we as a civilization have barely touched the tip of the iceberg of its potential use-cases.

What I hope to do is to instantaneously connect these dots, these compilations of experiences, relationships, and knowledge, and make on-the-go meaning out of it. And by meaning I don’t just mean what someone’s college major should be, or what high-paying job someone should pursue. But more so what someone finds beauty in, what their passions are, what sparks them. I feel like a lot of people ask the wrong questions when they try to navigate their lives, especially in a time like college. I hope to make people understand that college (and life) is not just about getting the fanciest job to impress your peers, or striving to run a business before the end of college to fit into the startup culture. Moreover, college and life should be a **personalized journey**, an instantaneous pursuit of discovery by which every millisecond mutates, transforms or grows an aspect of one’s identity, biologically, spiritually, physically, mentally, and the other entities that we have yet to discover or I forgot to mention. Ideally, instantaneous data (along with its appropriate manipulations) should help guide us towards this self pursuit. Ideally, this apparatus (or whatever it will be) should be used from a young age, so that one could explore their possibilities and potential much earlier.
