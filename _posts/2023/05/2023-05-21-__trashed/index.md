My first year at Vanderbilt just finished a couple weeks ago. I think I have now come to the conclusion that STEM might not be for me. I have given up this idealized view of myself and taken some time to reflect on what I’m actually good at, and how to make those skills employable. I’ve decided to use this summer to enhance my knowledge in economics and business, and one of the key ways I’m doing this is through reading books–a lot of books.

My first read this summer was _Freakonomics_ by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. This book surveys several “unusual” situations by which economic thinking and objective analysis can lead one to factually surprising results. Throughout the book, the authors remind us to always challenge “conventional wisdom”: according to Kenneth Galbraith, “we associate truth with convenience, with what most closely accords with self-interest and personal well-being or promises best to avoid awkward effort or unwelcome dislocations of life. We also find highly acceptable what contributes most to self-esteem.” The authors thoroughly dispel our assumptions and biases, our emotions and subjective opinions, and guide us to gaining factual answers with the most objective tool that we have at our own convenience: data.

One of the key things that I learned from this book was **marginal incentives**. Everyone has an incentive to do something, and any marginal task that is at their disposal is only pursued if he or she has enough marginal incentive to do so. An example that I really enjoyed from the book was hiring a real-estate “expert”. Levitt and Dubner claim that the benefit that you can get from hiring a realtor is at the cost of their own independent incentives. Let’s say that you hired a real estate agent to help sell your house. Your goal is to find someone that is willing to purchase your listed property **and** at a price that can break-even or (even better) bring you some profit. Hence, your incentive is your potential liquidity to fulfill other expenses or to purchase another home. Your agent also has incentives, although slightly different. Your agent gets a 4% commission for the sale of your property: this means that if they were able to sell your property for $100,000 for example, they earn four percent of the total cash ($4,000) while you earn the remaining ($96,000).

Now, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of the realtor. Say that you (the realtor) could potentially sell the home for an extra $5,000 given that you put in extra effort into renovating the home and marketing it to potential purchasers. This means that the home could be sold for $105,000, with you earning $4,200 (applying the 4% commission) and the property owner earning $100,800. This is a **huge** advantage for the home owner–They earn almost an extra $5,000! While this may be beneficial for them, will it really be the same case for you? Will a couple hundred bucks justify the amount of time and labor that you put into the property? Of course not. This is because the marginal benefit (the extra $200) is easily crushed by the marginal cost (the extra effort being put towards selling the house). This is a reasonable tradeoff that most rational people will be willing to make.

I’ve found myself applying this idea of **marginal incentives** to a lot of the decisions that I make. For example, I am expected by my mother to thoroughly clean the kitchen in my household everyday. This includes sub-tasks such as doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and cleaning the counters. For each sub-task I fulfill, the satisfaction that my mother gets increases, but the rate by which it increases is conditional! Here is a graph below to give you a visualization of this function.

As seen above, the first couple sub-tasks that I complete barely adds to my mother’s satisfaction. Because my incentive is to maximize my mother’s satisfaction, I need to continue completing sub-tasks until I can surpass my desired threshold, indicated by **A**. As soon as I pass this point, I am less incentivized to continue fulfilling sub-tasks because the marginal cost (the extra sub-task that I have to fulfill) is not worth the marginal benefit (a minuscule addition to my mother’s satisfaction)

Overall, I think _Freakonomics_ is an excellent read, and I’d recommend it to anyone who always questions things around them. This book is for the extremely curious, and for those that are willing to do what it takes to question conventional wisdom and do what it takes to find the objective (maybe sometimes controversial but nonetheless true) truth.
