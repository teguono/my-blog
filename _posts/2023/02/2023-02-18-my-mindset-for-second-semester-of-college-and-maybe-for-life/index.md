I came in my first semester in college with one sole goal — to try as many new things as possible. Whether that is joining new organizations, trying drinks for the first time, or going to parties, my goal was to enrich myself through exposing myself to various perspectives. This seemed like an idealized plan at first, but its implementation came with a lot of costs. Here is a list of them:

- **_Lack of Solitude_****:** I didn’t give myself time to actually think through what I **actually** wanted to do, but rather rode the wave and followed other people and their endeavors. I’ve come to learn the true importance of critical thinking. Critical thinking, for me, is defined as thoughtful, contextualized pondering for the purpose of discovering new things about one’s self or any sort of discipline. In order to succeed in critical thinking, one needs solitude–a space by which one has the freedom of thought and expression to create new things through deep analysis and self-reflection. Lacking that first semester, my overall quality of life decreased because most of the activities that I partook in were a product of shallow thought, and hence shallow experiences.

- **_Distraction:_** I won’t lie: It’s easy for me to get distracted at times. First semester might have been the period where I’ve succumbed to the most temptations and distractions in my life. Eating out with my schoolmates on a weekday overtook thinking critically through a calculus assignment. Group “study” sessions took the place of working out and playing basketball. One of the reasons why I look back at first semester with so much regret is because I feel like I spent the majority of my time doing things that I (deep inside) didn’t want to, which I believe came because of _cost #1._ Lack of critical thinking uproots lack of focus, and lack of focus uproots lack of discipline. Lack of discipline leads to getting distracted more easily, which was the state I was in throughout the first semester.

- **_FOMO:_** Trust me; FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is not a mindset that you want to have if you want to be an independent thinker. I recall a lot of instances in first semester where a lot of the decisions that I made were due to the thought of potential regret for not partaking in it. This is the mindset that a lot of students that I’ve met in college have. They want to try every single thing because that’s what the culture around them encourages them to do. However, I’ve come to learn that there’s a fine line between “exploration” and discipline. Instead of having to go to that party because all of my friends were going there, I could have spent all that time building a web app for a hackathon, writing Medium articles, or reading an interesting novel.

These were some of the key points and observations that I reflected on during my winter break. I truly realized that I didn’t work hard and deeply on something that I cared about, but rather chased what other people thought was important to them. I wasn’t the one creating the great body of water by which waves are created, I was the one riding the wave, blind to the realization that I am in someone else’s body of water. My goal is to create **my own** body of water, determining where the waves go, when the storm comes and goes, and who inhabits the space. I believe that I am becoming more proactive towards this goal in my second semester as I slowly become more aware of my weaknesses and eliminating them, but I believe that there are several strengths that I have that I still need to catalyze.

- **_Hard Work:_** Above all things, I believe hard work is the most important trait for anyone that desires to achieve a goal of any sort. I am immensely disappointed by the majority of people that I’ve met (including myself) that talk about all of their aspirations and desires, but their current lifestyle opposes that of someone who has achieved those things. It especially hurts me when I observe that about myself. There are a lot of things that I tell people that I’m going to work on or that I’m currently working on (for example, creating a chrome extension for instant evaluation of professors in my university) that I simply never push through. Almost 100% of the pursuits that I tell other people about never push through. The #1 thing that I’ve learned from this is to **never** tell other people what I’m up to until I’ve achieved what I intended to do. I believe that through doing this, I will slowly become more of a **doer** than a **dreamer–**but in order to be a doer, hard work inevitably has to be in the equation.

- **_Priorities:_** I’ll be very honest–I still have no idea what my priorities are. Well, I think I do, but the world tells me the complete opposite. The things that truly make me happy (building, learning, exploring) mostly contradict the things that my parents and schoolmates prioritize (GPA, academic/career validation, social approval). A lot of people think I’m crazy when I mention that the latter is not in the highest of my priorities, so I’ve decided not to mention it to anybody and quietly work on those aspects. The key thing is this: despite what the world tells me about what I should actually prioritize, when I set out time to do what I actually want to do, I feel like I have more control of myself. I feel like I’m actually **living.** The dilemma from my end is that I simply cannot commit to both; it has to be either what the world wants or what I want. But I simply have too much self-respect to sacrifice life to live for others', and hence would rather focus on my priorities.

- **_Health:_** I am very grateful to have been born with great genes and a good immune system. It has given me a lot of physical advantages that my peers endlessly seek after. However, I need to work on being excellent both on the outside and on the inside. I take this inspiration from Steve Jobs’ philosophy towards Apple Products: they’re beautiful **both** on the outside and on the inside–even though consumers barely get the opportunity to peek there. This level of pristine conditions is what I want to have in terms of my health; I’m not working out and eating healthy just because of the looks from other people, but rather because of the beauty in the process by which my insides and outsides can grow from such a rigorous process.

First semester has taught me a lot about being my own self. I am truly grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to reflect and learn from this earlier on in my life than much later. I hope to not only identify more of my weaknesses and eliminate them, but also learn how to turn those weaknesses into strengths and also optimize my already existing strengths.
